	When using Masque: While resizing with glow effect enabled  (Masque loaded, but styling set to "disabled"), the icon gets inset and it looks weird.
		Possibly fixable by unregistering from masque or adding a "Enable Masque" setting, and unregister when that is changed?
		When resizing without masque, the size won't update? Glow effect and size are correct, but the texture isn't displayed right?
