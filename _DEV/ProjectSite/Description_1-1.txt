Features

Adds tooltip information for artifact power items. Currently, the following can be displayed:

    Number of artifact power tokens in the player's inventory
    Total artifact power in bags
    Progress towards next trait
    Available number of traits (if applicable)

The tooltip can be customized somewhat, allowing users to decide which parts they want to include.

TotalAP also displays a button whenever artifact power items are in the player's inventory:

    Indicates that new traits are available via spell overlay (glow effect similar to that of spell procs)
    Includes keybinds (via Blizzard's KeybindUI) to use AP items, or hide the button manually
    Button can be skinned using the Masque (formerly ButtonFacade) addon library
    Hold ALT-Click while dragging to move the button, or SHIFT-Click while dragging to change its size

Slash commands

The following slash commands are provided: /totalap and /ap (alias)

A more detailed list will be printed ingame (see screenshots).
Localisation

Localisation is fully implemented, but no actual translation exists (yet). If you can help out, it will be appreciated! You can check on the current translation progress here: Project site
