<h2>Features</h2>
All of the main features can be disabled/toggled via keybindings and slash commands, allowing you to change the way most of the information is displayed.
<h3>Tooltip Enhancement</h3>
<p>Adds tooltip information for artifact power items. Currently, the following can be displayed:</p>
<ul>
<li>Number of artifact power tokens in the player's inventory</li>
<li>Total artifact power in bags</li>
<li>Progress towards next trait</li>
<li>Available number of traits (if applicable)</li>
</ul>
<p>The tooltip can be customized somewhat, allowing users to decide which parts (if any) they want to include.</p>
<h3>Action Button</h3>
<p>TotalAP also displays a button whenever artifact power items are in the player's inventory.
It can be used to quickly use the AP items without having to find them manually in your bags.</p>
<ul>
<li>Indicates that new traits are available via spell overlay (glow effect similar to that of spell procs)</li>
<li>Includes keybinds (via Blizzard's KeybindUI) to use AP items, or hide the button manually</li>
<li>Button can be skinned using the <a href="https://mods.curse.com/addons/wow/masque">Masque</a> (formerly ButtonFacade) addon library</li>
<li>Hold ALT-Click while dragging to move the button, or SHIFT-Click while dragging to change its size</li>
</ul>
<h3>Bar Display</h3>
<p>It is now possible to display the current progress of any spec's artifact weapon while considering all AP in the player's inventory as well.</p>
<ul>
<li>Separate colours are used to indicate the amount of artifact power used on the weapon vs. AP items that still remaining unused</li>
<li>Each specialization's progress will be cached when activated, and frequently while it remains so</li>
<li>If a spec isn't displayed initially, simply switch to it once to have it be updated</li>
<li>Hold ALT-Click while dragging to move them, along with the rest of the display</li>
</ul>
<h3>Specialization Icons/Text</h3>
<p>Another means of portraying the progress for all specs is in the form of these icons.</p>
<ul>
<li>Indicates that new traits are available via similar spell overlay (glow effect) as the action button</li>
<li>Displays progress and number of available traits as text next to each icon</li>
<li>Clicking the icon for a particular specialization activates it</li>
<li>Also supports <a href="https://mods.curse.com/addons/wow/masque">Masque</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>Slash commands</h2>
<p>The following slash commands are provided: <strong>/totalap</strong> and <strong>/ap</strong> (alias)</p>
<p>A more detailed list will be printed ingame (see screenshots).</p>
<h2>Localisation</h2>
<p>Localisation is fully implemented, but most locales are not translated (yet). If you can help out, it will be appreciated! You can check on the current translation progress here: <a href="https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/totalap/localization">Project site</a></p>
<h2>Feedback/Issues/Feature Requests</h2>
