## TotalAP v1.4.0 - Recent changes (3 releases)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

r23:
	Added support for artifact power items that are stored in the player's bank (experimental). They will be cached whenever the bank tab is opened, and the respective progress bars can be disabled with the /ap scanbank command
	
	Saved variables are now managed differently. They should be migrated to the new format automatically, but if something goes wrong, the settings might have to be reset. In that case, apologies! ()Also, please let me know so I can fix it)
	The progress bar tooltip will now indicate when a tier 1 artifact can be updated to its maximum rank. Additionally, the respective miniBar will no longer be displayed in those cases
	
	Fixed an issue where glow effects for the specIcons would not be applied correctly for tier 1 artifacts when too many traits were available
	

r22:
	Added option to toggle between using the international and localised number formats for each locale (experimental). It is accessible via slash command: /ap numberformat
	
	Updated detection for maxed artifact weapons (was disabled after tier 2 became available, but now applies to only tier 1 artifacts). They now show as "maxed" once again
	
	Fixed an issue that could cause high numbers of artifact power (> 2.14b) to break the addon's output under certain circumstances
	Fixed a bug that would cause tier 1 artifacts (those that haven't yet been upgraded via the Dalaran Council's quest chain) to display inaccurate values beyond the final, 54th trait
	Fixed a graphics glitch that caused the buttonText to collide with the bar display when using locales with a larger-than-normal default font size (koKR, zhCN, zhTW mainly) - this workaround is not ideal, and somewhat experimental
	
	
r21:
	Added slash command to hide the secondary progress bars ("MiniBar") -> /ap minibar
	
	Updated DB to include 7.2.5 artifact power items and their spell effects
	Updated translation for the Traditional Chinese (zhTW) locale - thanks for contributing!
	Modified progress bar tooltip to indicate when research is idle, and when the maximum AK level has been reached
	
	Fixed ingame description for the "/ap progress" slash command
	Fixed progress bar tooltip for artifact weapons that have never been used before
	Fixed a graphics glitch that could occur when the buttonText became too long to fit smoothly in its space
	Fixed a graphics glitch that lead to the MiniBar being displayed over other, arguably more important UI frames
	Fixed an issue where the displayed shipment info for Artifact Research Notes could be inaccurate
