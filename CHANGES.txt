## TotalAP v1.5.0 - Recent changes (3 releases)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

r25:
	
	Reworked the display (GUI) to allow further customization (in future updates). This might temporarily cause some minor problems, but should ultimately fix the long-standing taint issues manifesting in seemingly random Lua errors during combat
	Added state indicators (icons) for events that would render the action button unusable or the display to be hidden, such as engaging in combat, pet battles, vehicular combat, or utilizing a Flight Master's services
	The former /ap combat slash command is now /ap autohide and toggles the automatic hiding of the displays during all relevant events (mentioned above) instead of only detecting combat. More fine-grained settings for this are coming soon (TM)
	

r24:
	
	Artifact Research Notes and similar items (catch-up tomes for alts) will now be ignored for players that haven't reached level 110 yet

	Fixed an issue that could prevent the displays from being dragged to the very bottom of the player's interface
	Fixed an issue where dropping from an instance group could cause the detection of ignored specs to fail temporarily
	Fixed a minor graphics glitch pertaining to the buttonText, manifesting only when AP items were stored in the bank
	Fixed the broken /ap reset slash command (caused by the changes made to saved variables handling in r23)
	

r23:
	Added support for artifact power items that are stored in the player's bank (experimental). They will be cached whenever the bank tab is opened, and the respective progress bars/tooltip lines can be disabled with the /ap scanbank command
	Added quest reward from the "Pillars of Creation" (Tomb of Sargeras) quest line to the addon's database. Somehow this wasn't added with all the other items from 7.2.5
	
	Saved variables are now managed differently. They should be migrated to the new format automatically; if something unexpectedly goes wrong, simply resetting them should fix it
	The progress bar tooltip will now indicate when a tier 1 artifact can be updated to its maximum rank. Additionally, the respective miniBar will no longer be displayed in those cases
	
	Fixed an issue where glow effects for the specIcons would not be applied correctly for tier 1 artifacts when too many traits were available
